# libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions &amp;&amp; set of some functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form.

### C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions.
Run
```
$> make
```
to create an object file ( **libft.a**), so then just compile with it, for instance:
```
$> gcc *.c libft.a
```
In addition to the standard functions, the library contains custom useful functions and I plan to continuously expand the library.
